## Some Learning Notes ##

### JVM Stack and Heap ###
* Heap is like a huge area for storing data. 
* Can think of the heap being all the memory for the application except for the data on the stack. 
* In an application there is one heap which is shared across all threads, and a number of stacks, one for each thread. 
As shown below.

* Heap makes it easy to pass objects around threads or code blocks. 

&nbsp;
* **All objects are stored on the heap.**
