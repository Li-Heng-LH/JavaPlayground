## Some Learning Notes ##

### POM ###
* project object: 
  * 1-1 relationship with build.gradle
  * this object is assigned to 'project' reference variable
  
* task object:
  * project -> task -> action
  * project is a collection of tasks
  * task is a collection of actions 
  * but we usually work on task level
  * usually there is only a single action per task
