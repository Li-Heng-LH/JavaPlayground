#  Try RxJava


## Some Learning Notes ##

### Reactive Extensions ###
* Reactive Extensions, ReactiveX, Rx
* Basically, asynchronous programming. 
* RxJava is the Java implementation of this concept. 
* RxJava provides Java API for asynchronous programming with observable streams.

&nbsp;

### Concepts ###
* **Observable** represents any object that can get data from a data source   
  and whose state may be of interest in a way that other objects may register an interest
* An **observer** is any object that wishes to be notified when the state of another object changes
* In Rx, an observer will never be called with an item out of order    
  or called before the callback has returned for the previous item.
